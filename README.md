# Welcome To info orbs! 
info orbs is a low cost open source multi-use desktop widget that can be used for things like time, weather, sports score, stock prices notifications & much more! I would love some help developing more widgets and fixing the codebase so that its a good foundation for building this to be something really cool :)
# First, a few housekeeping items for anyone interested in helping with this project, or building one for themselves
- This project is very early stages, if you would like to help out or have questions, please join my discord [here](https://discord.gg/f5YqpMTJNm) and mentioned you have questions/want to help out with the project and i'll invite you to the appropriate channels.
- The soldering/ wiring on this is tricky, I'm currently in the process of building out dev kits that will include both full kits with all parts needed, or just PCBs to save hassle on wiring. Please enquire over email at brett@btruner.tech or via the discord above if you'd like to get your hands on one early.
- This was my first "real" project i've ever built, that being said there's likely allot of common sense stuff missed in regards to code structure, file structure, using the wrong variable types, etc. If you see anything of that nature that makes sense to fix please do, I want this code base to be one people hope to be working on long term.
- I choose the ESP32 for this build due to its low cost and ease of production when I build more refined PCBs, however if it's restricting people's abilities to develop your own widgets I would love to hear ideas for other options (:

Lastly, two big things coming over the next few days that will make development allot easier:
1) A trello board
2) A simulated dev environment so folks can test code without needing to get their hands on hardware
