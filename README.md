# Welcome To info orbs! An open source multi-use desptop widget that can be used for things like time, weather, sports score, stock prices notifcations & much more!
I would love some help developing more widgets and fixing the codebase so that its a good foundation for building this to be something really cool (:)
# First, a few housekeeping items for anyone interested in helping wiht this project, or building one for themselves
- This project is very early stages, if you would like to help out or have questions, please join my discord [here](https://discord.gg/f5YqpMTJNm) and mentioned you have questions/want to help out with the project and i'll invite you to the appropraite channels.
- The soldering/ wiring on this is tricky, I'm currently in the process of building out dev kits that will include both full kits with all parts needed, or just PCBs to save hassle on wiring. Please enquire over email at brett@btruner.tech or via the discord above if you'd like to get your hands on one early. 
- This was my first "real" project i've ever built, that being said theres likely allot of common sense stuff missed in reagrds to code structure, file structure, using the wrong varibale types, etc. If you see anything of that nature that makes sense to fix please do, I want this code base to be one people hope to be working on long term.
- I choose the ESP32 for this build due to its low cost and ease of production when I build more refined PCBs, however if it's retricting peoples abilities to develop your own widgets I would love to hear ideas for other options (:

Lastly, two big things coming over the next few days that will make development allot easier:
1) A trello board
2) A simualted dev enviorment so folks can test code without needing to get their hands on hardware
